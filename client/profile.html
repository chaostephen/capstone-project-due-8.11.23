        <p>I am a dynamic business professional with a passion for entrepreneurship, technology, and innovation. With a wealth of experience in the financial industry, I have established myself as a leader in the field, excelling in business development, project management, and strategic planning. I have a proven track record of delivering successful projects and building strong relationships with clients and stakeholders.
        </p>
        <p>As someone who is always exploring new opportunities and pushing boundaries, I'm currently enrolled in an intensive cybersecurity bootcamp, where I'm learning red team skills, such as breaking into networks, finding weaknesses and vulnerabilities. What I'm enjoying most about cybersecurity is programming in Javascript, Python, and Ruby. I enjoy learning to set-up and properly configure networks. And finally, I enjoy learning about the OSINT model.
        </p>
        <p>With my strong interest in technology and my entrepreneurial spirit, I'm looking forward to make a significant impact on the tech industry for years to come.
